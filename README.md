# horiseon-site-code-refactoring

Description:
Horiseon site needed lots of code rafactoring done using the best practices. I used accurate HTML smeantics to properly organise and structure my code, so the site becomes more accessible to visually impaired. Every section of the page has proper HTML semantics, all the headings follow sequential order and every image has an alt tag.  all the repository follows the best file structure and naming conventions.

Screenshot of the site:
